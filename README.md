*About the Rook piece:*
I looked up the official rules for how each piece moves.
 I read that a rook can move forward, backward, left or right.
 The directions on Canvas say that a rook can move only forwards, left, or right.
 My code allows for backwards movement as well since technically the rook can move backwards.
 However, as long as the rook is not moved backwards, it follows the directions from Canvas.
